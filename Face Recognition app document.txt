Face Recognition Attendance System Documentation

Introduction

This project is a face recognition-based attendance system built using Python, OpenCV, and the face_recognition library. The application allows users to log in by recognizing their faces and to register new users into the system. Attendance logs are saved in a log.txt file, recording the name and datetime of successful logins.

Features

Face Recognition for Login

Detects and recognizes registered users' faces.

Logs attendance with timestamp into log.txt.

User Registration

Captures and saves new users' face images.

Stores user data in the db directory for future recognition.

Live Webcam Feed

Streams webcam video feed within the application.

Project Structure

db Directory to store user face images.

log.txt File to log attendance records.

util.py Utility functions for button creation, image labeling, and message display.

main.py Main script containing the application logic.

Dependencies

Python 3.x

Libraries

tkinter For GUI elements.

cv2 (OpenCV) For webcam integration and image processing.

PIL (Pillow) For handling image objects in the GUI.

face_recognition For facial recognition.

datetime For logging timestamps.

subprocess For executing external face recognition commands.

How It Works

Login Process

Captures a frame from the webcam.

Uses the face_recognition library to match the face against registered user images in the db directory.

Displays a welcome message and logs the event if a match is found.

Displays an error message if no match is found.

User Registration

Captures a frame from the webcam.

Prompts the user to input their name.

Saves the captured image in the db directory with the entered name as the filename.

Usage Instructions

Set Up

Ensure Python and all dependencies are installed.

Create a directory named db in the same location as the script.

Ensure face_recognition is installed and configured.

Run the Application

Execute the script using python main.py.

Login

Stand in front of the webcam.

Press the Login button.

Register a New User

Press the Register New User button.

Enter the username and click Accept.

Attendance Logs

Check log.txt for attendance records.

Notes

Ensure that the db directory and log.txt file are located in the same directory as the script.

The application uses the first connected webcam by default.

Limitations

Requires a clear and well-lit image for accurate face recognition.

Does not support multiple users in the frame during login.

Future Improvements

Add support for multiple webcams.

Enhance accuracy by preprocessing the face images.

Include a graphical report generator for attendance.

Implement database integration for scalable storage.
